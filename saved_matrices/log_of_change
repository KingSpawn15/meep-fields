in set1 everything standard
in set2 flipped sign of current y
in set3 0 current y
in set4 changed depth to alpha

in set5 revert back tp set1 but store both angles
in set6 flipped sign of current y
in set7 its not 0 and 90 its 80 and 100
in set8 its not 0 and 90 its 70 and 110
in set9 its not 0 and 90 its 60 and 120

Bizarre set 7 and 9 are all the same

in set11 its not 0 and 90 its 0 and 90, that seems ok
in set12 its 45 and 135 strange pattern of fields. To compare the magnitude I should do 0 and 45
in set13 its 0 and 45 strange pattern of fields.
in set14 its 30 and 15. will it reprodruce asymmetry?
